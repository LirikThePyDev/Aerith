## AERITH

Aerith is a Python 3.15-inspired interpreter implemented in Python, supporting async/await, generators, coroutines, pattern matching, decorators, dataclasses, context managers, operator overloading, metaclasses, and superuser mode. It enables writing advanced scripts with Python-like syntax in a non-interactive runtime environment.

## Usage
In Python, run:

from aerith import execute_script

execute_script('myscript.aerith')
